# Day 1-2 Progress Log: Historical Goalie Starts

**Date:** Feb 6, 2026
**Tasks:** Extract goalie starts, build game-level features, backup indicators, rest tracking

## Completed

### 1. Goalie Start Extraction
- **Source:** MoneyPuck shots data (468MB, 2018-2025)
- **Method:** Extracted `goalieIdForShot` and `goalieNameForShot` per game
- **Output:** `data/goalie_starts/game_goalie_starts.csv`
- **Coverage:** 8,468 games with goalie start data

### 2. Game-Level Goalie Features
- Who started each game (goalie_id, goalie_name)
- Shots faced in periods 1-2 (early shots)
- Total shots faced in game
- Relief appearance indicator (was backup pulled in?)

### 3. Backup Start Indicator
- Backup defined as: <40% of team starts in last 30 days
- **Home backup rate:** 21.8%
- **Away backup rate:** 24.8%

### 4. Goalie Rest Days + B2B
- Days since last start for each goalie
- Back-to-back (B2B) start flags:
  - Home B2B: 1.4%
  - Away B2B: 2.8%

## Key Findings

### Backup Start Win Rates
| Scenario | Win Rate | N |
|----------|----------|---|
| Home backup | 49.8% | 1,818 |
| Home starter | 50.5% | 6,535 |
| Away backup (away wins) | 48.7% | 2,071 |
| Away starter (away wins) | 50.0% | 6,282 |

**Insight:** Small edge (~1-2%) exists for backup starts. The real edge is in **timing** - the 15-60 minute window before markets fully adjust to backup announcements.

## Files Created
1. `scripts/data/extract_goalie_starts.py` - Extraction script
2. `scripts/features/goalie_features.py` - Feature engineering
3. `data/goalie_starts/game_goalie_starts.csv` - Raw goalie starts
4. `data/processed/matchups_with_goalie.csv` - Matchups with 38 goalie features

## New Features (38 total)
- `home_goalie_id`, `home_goalie_name`, `away_goalie_id`, `away_goalie_name`
- `home_goalie_rest_days`, `away_goalie_rest_days`
- `home_goalie_b2b`, `away_goalie_b2b`
- `home_backup_start`, `away_backup_start`
- `home_goalie_sv_L10`, `away_goalie_sv_L10`
- `goalie_rest_diff`, `b2b_diff`, `backup_mismatch`, `goalie_tier_diff`, `goalie_sv_diff`
- Plus existing goalie features from previous work

## Next Steps (Day 3-4)
- Fetch opening lines from The Odds API (need more credits)
- Calculate line movement features
- Build reverse line movement indicator

## Notes
- MoneyPuck shots data only has season 2018+ (older seasons don't have goalie info in shots)
- The game_id format required conversion (season * 1M + game_num)
- Rolling save percentage is estimated (no goals-against in shots data)
